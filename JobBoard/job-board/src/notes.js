    1) can make simple function returning Componeent in place of seperate Component JobList.js 
    2) can give anchor tag in place of hover + openByURL or navigate method 
    <a rel="noopener noreferre"/>
    The rel=”noopener” tag is designed to plug a gap in security, which can allow malicious websites 
    and cybercriminals to hijack the browser tab that was used to click a link while the user is busy
     using the new tab that has opened. The rel=”noreferrer” tag, meanwhile, prevents websites from seeing 
     that your website sent traffic their way.

    3)  ( new Date("") ).methosOfConversion()  or new Date("").methodOfConversion 
    4) load then style , Data layer -> UI laiyer ;)
    
    5) role="list" 
     Typically, lists are created using <ul>, <ol>, and <li> elements, 
     which are inherently recognized as lists by browsers and assistive technologies.
      However, if you are using a different element and want to explicitly mark it as a list
    for accessibility purposes, you can use role="list".


    6) IMP, avoid multiple api call if the data hs not loaded yet by disabled tg
    

    7) IMP, usinf Prmise.all to load a list of items, in place of individual listign a they come in the group of 6 ;) 
    So, passing the job id array is better in place of simple jon id 
    When you want to handle multiple asynchronous operations concurrently and wait for all of them to complete before proceeding,
    you can use Promise.all() to achieve this
        returns Promise which in turn have array of items 

]   8) can use slice in place of filtr , sort emthd , as I want substring , filter for special conditions

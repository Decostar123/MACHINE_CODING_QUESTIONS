1) useRef varible with conditional renderering can not work 
2) give key to the json data created ,can be used i nthe msp 
3) solve for one level first and acordingly break the poblems 
4) can use onBlur when we click outside of input, in place of  document.addEcenetListenr( 'click' , (e)=> e.target.className )
5) Date.now() or uuid for package 

6) Can also use DFS algorithm  in place of direct insertion , for goin to te particular level 
in this case make a custom hook having the fucntion to insert node 

7) make content arra in bith file as well as folder so that recursiove solution is easy , 
benfit of the recursive solution is that it makes a new array
